# HeartDiseasePrediction
Machine learning is extensively used in Health Care . Machine learning can play a very important role in predicting presence/absence of medical disorders. Heart plays a very significant role in every living organism. Human heart is the principal part of the human body.Human heart basically does three main functions: Transport of nutrients, oxygen, and hormones to cells throughout the body and removal of metabolic wastes. Any irregularity to heart can cause distress in other parts of body.

Heart disease may be because of several contributory risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, abnormal pulse rate and many other factors. Even if heart diseases are found as the prime source of death in the world in recent years, they are also the ones that can be controlled and managed effectively.Machine learning (ML) has been shown to be effective in assisting in making decisions and predictions from the data produced by the healthcare industry.Therefore,if these diseases are predicted well in advance ,it would be a great help for diagnosis purpose
